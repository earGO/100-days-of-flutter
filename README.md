# hundred_days_css

It is a https://100dayscss.com challenge, but with Flutter!

## Getting Started

The app is a simple PageView with navigation between the challenges with swipes to the right and to the left. 

I have started from a Day 1 (with whatever was there at the time I've started this), and committed to complete all 100 of those.

I am doing that on some evenings though, so it will take me a while to pick up some speed with Flutter, but it was REALLY fun when I've done these with CSS.
